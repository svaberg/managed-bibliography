\subsection*{Example \texttt{latexmkrc} file}
Here is an example of a \texttt{latexmkrc} file that loads the \texttt{managed-bibliography.pl} script and sets some options:

\lstset{
    language=Perl,
    commentstyle=\color{gray},
    basicstyle=\ttfamily\small,
}
\lstinputlisting{latexmkrc}

\section*{Example citations}
Papers that use the ADS citation keys are automatically included in the managed bibliography file \texttt{adstex.keys.bib}.
Here are some examples of such citations:
\cite{%
    1958ZA.....46..108B,%
    1962AJ.....67..471K,%
    1966AJ.....71...64K%
}. 
Here are a few more
\cite{2002Sci...295...82K,2003PASP..115..763C}. 

Works that are not in the ADS database can be cited as usual by providing a custom bibliography file. Here is an example: \cite{mcgrail2004}.


\bibliographystyle{plain}
\bibliography{adskeys,custom}
