This script uses NASA ADS citation keys with \texttt{adstex} so that you can forget about your bibliography management! The extension fetches and caches the bibliography entries from the NASA ADS database automatically. The extension creates and manages a bibliography file named \texttt{adstex.keys.bib} in the working directory. 

Custom citations with keys not in the ADS database can be added by providing one or more additional bibliography files, as is done in the source file for this document.

\subsection*{How it works}
The \texttt{latexmkrc} file has been extended with a custom Perl script that runs \texttt{adstex} automatically as part of the build process. The script scans the LaTeX source file for citation keys, checks which keys are already known (cached) in the local bibliography file, and fetches any missing entries from the NASA ADS database using \texttt{adstex}. The fetched entries are then added to the managed bibliography file, which is used during the LaTeX compilation. During the process the extension makes use a temporary TeX file \texttt{.keys.txt} which is built from itself and the \texttt{.aux} file and consumed by \texttt{adstex}. After a deep clean (\texttt{latexmk -C}), the extension builds everything in 3--4 passes which is what \texttt{latexmk} normally does anyway. 

Keys that are no longer used in the document are not automatically removed from the managed bibliography file, but they can be removed manually by deleting the \texttt{adstex.keys.bib} file and rebuilding the document.
