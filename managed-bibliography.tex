\section*{Managed bibliography with NASA ADS citation keys} 

\input{README.tex}

\subsection*{Example citations}
Papers that use the ADS citation keys are automatically included in the managed bibliography file \texttt{adstex.keys.bib}.
Here are some examples of such citations:
\cite{%
    1958ZA.....46..108B,%
    1962AJ.....67..471K,%
    1966AJ.....71...64K%
}. 
Here are a few more
\cite{2002Sci...295...82K,2003PASP..115..763C}. 

Works that are not in the ADS database can be cited as usual by providing a custom bibliography file. Here is an example: \cite{mcgrail2004}.


\bibliographystyle{plain}
\bibliography{adstex.keys.bib,custom}
